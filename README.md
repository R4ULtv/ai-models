## Model Information

Each model includes comprehensive metadata:

- **Basic Info**: Name, provider, unique identifiers
- **Capabilities**: Tools, vision, reasoning, embedding support
- **Modalities**: Input/output support for text, audio, image, video, PDF
- **Pricing**: Input/output costs per million tokens, cache pricing
- **Limits**: Context window and output token limits
- **Features**: Temperature support, attachment handling, knowledge cutoff

## Getting Started

Models are served directly from a Cloudflare Worker. You can find the worker's source code [here](https://github.com/R4ULtv/ai-db/tree/main/.cloudflare/apis/src).

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- pnpm (recommended) or npm

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/R4ULtv/ai-db.git
cd ai-db
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Run the development server:
```bash
pnpm dev
```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser. The models will be fetched from the Cloudflare Worker.

## Adding New Models

To add a new model to the database:

1. Create a JSON file in the appropriate provider directory under [`public/`](.cloudflare/apis/public).
2. Follow the schema structure defined in `lib/schema.ts`:

```json
{
  "id": "gemini-2.5-pro",
  "name": "Gemini 2.5 Pro",
  "provider": "Google",
  "provider_id": "google",
  "capabilities": [
    "tools",
    "reasoning",
    "vision"
  ],
  "attachment": true,
  "temperature": true,
  "knowledge": "2025-01",
  "modalities": {
    "input": [
      "text",
      "image",
      "audio",
      "video",
      "pdf"
    ],
    "output": [
      "text"
    ]
  },
  "cost": {
    "input": 1.25,
    "output": 10,
    "cache_read": 0.31
  },
  "limit": {
    "context": 1048576,
    "output": 65536
  }
}}
}
```

### Schema Fields

- `id`: Unique identifier for the model
- `name`: Display name of the model
- `provider`: Human-readable provider name
- `provider_id`: Provider identifier slug
- `capabilities`: Array of supported capabilities
- `attachment`: Whether the model supports file attachments
- `temperature`: Whether the model supports temperature parameter
- `knowledge`: Knowledge cutoff date (optional)
- `input_modalities`: Supported input types (optional)
- `output_modalities`: Supported output types (optional)
- `cost`: Pricing information (per million tokens)
- `limit`: Context and output token limits
